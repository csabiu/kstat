0) Intro

I present some correlation codes for calculating some interesting quantities.
These include the two-point correlation function in 2 and 3-dimensions, the 
anisotripic 2PCF decomposed in either sigma-pi or Kazin's dist. mu projection.

I created these codes as I have found it difficult in the past find similar ones 
freely available in the pubilc domain. I hope to keep developing them, so please 
send me bug fixes,suggestions, comments/critisims to csabiu@gmail.com

Depending on how useful these algorithms are for you, payback is accpeted in 
the form of co-authorship, aknowledgments or just beer is fine too ;)

1) Programs

This is a collection of programs for calculating 
correlation functions 

     -----------------
a)   **    2pcf     **
     -----------------

PURPOSE: Code for calculating the 2PCF of a 2D (projected) or full 3D point set. 
         In either isotropic or anisotropic modes.
        - The anisotropic decomposition is done in either distance,mu space - Ie Clustering wedges
        - See Kazin etal 2013 http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4391 for details
        - OR decomposition can be done in sigma,pi space.
        - For now binning is symentric in sigma and pi (will be altered later)

CALLING SEQUENCE:
      2pcf [-gal gal_file] [-ran ran_file] [-out out_file] [-wgt WGT]
           [-iso ISO] [-decp DECOMP][-rmin Rmin] [-rmax Rmax] [-nbins Nbins]
           [-log LOG] [-proj PROJ] [-RR RR_counts] [-err ERR] [-nerr NERR]
           [-njk NJK] [-mkd MKD]

      eg: 2pcf -gal dr9.gal -ran dr9.ran -rmin 1.0 -rmax 100.0 -nbins 20
      eg: 2pcf -gal dr9.gal -ran dr9.ran -rmin 1.0 -rmax 100.0 -nbins 20 -err jack -njk 3
 
INPUTS:
       gal_file/ranfile = strings containing the name of a 3/4 column point file
                 lines 1-3: XYZ comoving, optional 4: weight  
             OR  lines 1-2: RA,DEC(degs), optional 3: weight  

       out_file = filename for output correlation func. Columns include min/max bin definitions
                  the normalised pair counts (DD,DR,RR) and the correlation function estimators.
   
       Rmin = Min. radial seperation (in units of input catalogue)
              Rmin is fixed = 0 for anisotropic SIGMA-PI decomposition. May change in future release.
 
       Rmax = Max. radial seperation (in units of input catalogue)
 
OPTIONAL:
       Nbins  = Number of radial bins to calculate. Default is 1.
                In the anisotripic SIGMA-PI case, this will be the number of bins in both axes
 
       NTbins = Number of theta/angualr bins to calculate, only if usnig -decmp SMU in anisotropic case
 
       PROJ   = Logical, if true then do 2D angular correlations. Data must be RA,DEC in degs.
                Possible values: .true.  OR  .false.
 
       WGT    = logical value to define if weights are to be included
                Possible values: .true.  OR  .false.
                In this case, the input gal/ran files should be 4 columns
 
       LOG    = Logical to define if bins should be logarithmically spaced
                Possible values: .true.  OR  .false.

       ISO    = Flag for either istoropic (ISO) or anisotropic (ANISO) clustering. If ANISO, choose
                decomposition method using -decp flag shown below.

       DECOMP = Decomposition of the anisotropic pair binning. SIGPI for the usual sigma-pi
                or SMU for s-mu seperation, where is the pair distance and mu is the cosine
                of the angle between the vector to gal1 and the connecting vector between 
                the galaxies.

    RR_Counts = string containing the name of a file regarding RR data counts.
                If file exists, then the RR counting will be skipped (saveing CPU time).
                If it does not exist, the file will be created for future use.
                Consider using this option if you are doing Monte Carlo runs with same 
                random catalogue and binning scheme.

         ERR  = The error treatment method for covariance estimation:
                "boot" - create bootstrap samples using random assignment
                "jack" - create jackknife samples using spatial partitioning
                "read" - read error subsample IDs from the data file (last column, integer)

        NERR  = Number of bootstrap samples to create (only used with -err boot).
                Covariance and correlation coefficients are output to covariance.out

         NJK  = Number of jackknife divisions per dimension (only used with -err jack).
                Total regions = NJK^D where D is dimensionality (2 for proj, 3 otherwise).
                Default is 3, giving 27 regions for 3D or 9 regions for 2D.
                Example: -njk 4 creates 64 jackknife regions for 3D data.

        MKD    = Logical to define if marked statistics should be used.
                 Possible values: .true.  OR  .false.

         - At the moment only 1 binning scheme is available.

         - This will be generalies in a future release.

       out_file = filename for output correlation func.
   
       Rmin = Min. radial seperation
   
       Rmax = Max. radial seperation
 
OPTIONAL:
      Nbins = Number of radial bins to calculate zeta. The 3rd side of the triangle is
              varied from theta=0-180 deg in Nbins spaced equally in cos(theta)
  
        WGT = logical value to define if weights are to be included
              Possible values: .true.  OR  .false.
              In this case, the input gal/ran files should be 4 columns

 RR_Counts = string containing the name of a file regarding RR data counts.
             If file exists, then the RR counting will be skipped (saveing CPU time).
             If it does not exist, the file will be created for future use.
             Consider using this option if you are doing Monte Carlo runs with same 
             random catalogue and binning scheme.

         - At the moment only 1 binning scheme is available.
         - You specify the minimum and maximum sides of the triangle and the number 
	 - of bins this should be divided into.

CALLING SEQUENCE:

           [-rmin Rmin] [-rmax Rmax] [-nbins Nbins] [-RSD RSD] [-nmu Nmu]
 
      eg: 3pcf_eq -gal dr9.gal -ran dr9.ran -rmin 10.0 -rmax 12.0 -nbins 4 -RSD .true. -nmu 5
 
INPUTS:
       gal_file/ranfile = strings containing the name of a 3/4 column point file
                 lines 1-3: XYZ comoving, optional 4: weight

2)  ** EXAMPLES **
    **************

In the folder "kstat/examples" you will find a data and random catalogues. 
They contains XYZ commoving coords, plus a weight column.
To get a feel for the codes, please run the following command from the 
examples folder.

./test.script

The testing script runs three examples detailed below. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1) 

In this example we calculate the 3D - isotropic 2-point correlation function 
from 1Mpc -> 20Mpc in 5 equally spaced bins. It also conciders the galaxy and random weights.

../bin/2pcf -gal test.gal -ran test.ran -rmin 1.0 -rmax 20.0 -nbins 5 -out result1 -wgt .true.


Example 2)

In this example we calculate the anisotropic 2-point correlation function decomposed into
the usual sigma (perpendicular) and pi (parallel) space. This is done in 10x10 bins from 0Mpc
to 100Mpc in each coordinate.

../bin/2pcf -gal test.gal -ran test.gal -rmax 100.0 -nrbin 10 -out result2 -iso ANISO -decp SIGPI

Example 3)

In this example we calculate the isotropic 2PCF with jackknife error estimation.
The data is spatially partitioned into 3^3=27 jackknife regions for covariance estimation.

../bin/2pcf -gal test.gal -ran test.ran -rmin 1.0 -rmax 50.0 -nbins 10 -out result3 -err jack -njk 3

Example 4)

In this example we look at the 3-point correlation function with the triangular configuration
7Mpc<r1<8Mpc, 5Mpc<r2<6Mpc, and the 3rd side is explored in 8 bins equally spaced in cos(theta).

../bin/3pcf -gal test.gal -ran test.ran -r1min 7 -r1max 8 -r2min 5 -r2max 6 -nbins 8 -wgt .true. -out result4


    **************
3)  ** ISSUES **
    **************

a) During openmpi runs I find that passing the following mpi arguments prevents the code from falling over:
   sabiuc@[~/]:mpirun -np 64 --mca btl mx,sm,self --mca mtl ^mx ./2pcf .......
